This contains the list of assumptions during the creation of the application and the additional requirements to ask the client.

Assumptions
1. I have chosen a simple user interface for clean and minimalist look.
2. I used the local host url for this project, http://localhost:8080/home.
3. I incorporated a persistence exception to my code.
4. Incorporated a service layer for my code aside from the MVC model.


Possible additional Requirements for full application experience:
1. Database connection, for data logging.
2. Complete Unit testing
3. Aside from data validations, incorporate exceptions.
4. Create a whole CRUD capability.


Questions for the Client:
1. What is the main purpose of the application? Where do you want me to focus more?
2. What is the visual presentation you wanted to see? Do you want it to keep simple and focus in the user friendly interface or you want a detailed interface?
3. What stack of technology you want me to incorporate in my build?
4. How long do you want me to work on this?
5. Do you want to store your data in a file or both file and database? Do you want to generate a detailed report or keep transaction logs?
6. What URL do you want me to use in this project?
