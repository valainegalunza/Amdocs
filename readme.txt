Clone the Repository
The next step is to create a local directory for the repo on your computer.

You can create the directory wherever you wish, as long as you know where it is. In this example, we will create a new directory in the Documents library, but you will need to use different path information if you choose to use a different location.

Navigate to the directory where you want to create the repository. In this case, we will start by opening the Documents library.

Open your preferred Git tool (Git Bash, Terminal, PowerShell, etc.) and navigate to the repos directory you just created.
